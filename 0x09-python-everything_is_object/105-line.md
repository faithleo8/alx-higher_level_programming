NSMALLPOSINTS:

It is a constant in the CPython interpreter's source code. Represents the number of small positive integers (from 0 to 256) preallocated in memory. These preallocated integers are shared among variables and objects for performance and memory optimization. NSMALLNEGINTS:

It is a constant in the CPython interpreter's source code. Represents the number of small negative integers (-5 to -1) preallocated in memory. These preallocated integers are shared among variables and objects for performance and memory optimization. Remember, these details are specific to CPython and may not apply to other Python implementations or versions. It's generally recommended to rely on the officially documented features and constants when writing portable Python code.
